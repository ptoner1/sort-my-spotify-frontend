<h1>Sort My Liked Spotify</h1>
<p>
  Ever wanted to sort your liked songs on Spotify?
</p>
<p>
  This user friendly application does just that.  If you want to look at the final product, go to https://www.sort-spotify.com

<h1>Using the Repo</h1>
<p>
  You'll have to use your Spotify account to create a project in their development console, found 
  <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login" target="_blank">
    here.
  </a>
  You can just use your login information that you already have as a user.  When you "create an app", it'll give you your Spotify SECRET and KEY environment variables.
</p>

<h1>Tweaking the Repo</h1>
<p>
  Spotify makes it clear that any apps that use its API need to be styled very similarly to it's actual base application: https://www.open.spotify.com so if
  you want to change the styling, don't go too far.  Read more

  Improvement Suggestions
</h3>
<p>
  If you want to allow the user to create a playlist of more than 100 songs, you could definitely do another work-around 
  like the "Add Songs" button on the homepage.
</p>
<p>
  Play Music!  This sounds like a tricky feat because we're already making a lot of calls to the API, but it could be done.
